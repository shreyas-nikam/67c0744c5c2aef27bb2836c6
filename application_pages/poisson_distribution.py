    The Poisson Distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. It is characterized by one parameter:
    
    $\lambda$ (lambda): The average number of events per interval
    
    The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:
    
    $$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
    
    Where:
    - $k$ is the number of occurrences
    - $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm
    
    Let's explore how changing the lambda parameter affects the shape of the distribution!

    ### Observations:
    
    1. The distribution is discrete, taking only non-negative integer values.
    2. As 位 increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric and approaches a normal distribution.
    3. For small values of 位, the distribution is skewed to the right.
    4. The peak of the distribution occurs near the value of 位.
    
    ### Properties of the Poisson Distribution:
    
    1. Mean (Expected value): $E(X) = \lambda$
    2. Variance: $Var(X) = \lambda$
    3. Standard Deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}$
    
    The Poisson distribution has the unique property that its mean and variance are equal.

    ### Applications of the Poisson Distribution:
    
    1. Modeling rare events: Number of car accidents, natural disasters, or defects in manufacturing.
    2. Queueing theory: Arrivals at a service center or calls to a help desk.
    3. Biology: Number of mutations in a given DNA sequence or cell divisions in a time interval.
    4. Finance: Number of trades in a given time period or defaults in a loan portfolio.
    
    The Poisson distribution is particularly useful when dealing with counts of events over time or space, especially when these events are rare and independent.
