# Exploring Probability Distributions

In this lab, we will explore various probability distributions and their properties. We'll focus on the following distributions:

1. Normal Distribution
2. Binomial Distribution
3. Poisson Distribution

We'll visualize these distributions, calculate probabilities, and explore how changing parameters affects their shapes and properties.

## Key Concepts

- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: A function that describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: A function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.
- **Parameters**: Values that define the shape and behavior of a distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation for the normal distribution).

Let's explore each distribution in detail and see how they behave under different conditions!
