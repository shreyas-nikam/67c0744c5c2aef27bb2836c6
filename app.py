In this lab, we will explore the concept of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and its application in financial modeling. 
GBM is a continuous-time stochastic process widely used to model stock prices and other financial instruments.

The Geometric Brownian Motion is defined by the following stochastic differential equation:

$$dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$$

Where:
- $S_t$ is the stock price at time $t$
- $\mu$ is the drift (expected return)
- $\sigma$ is the volatility
- $dW_t$ is a Wiener process (standard Brownian motion)

We'll simulate GBM paths, visualize them, and analyze their properties across different pages of this application.
